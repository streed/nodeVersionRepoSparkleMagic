# nodeVersionRepoSparkleMagic
Sometime you have a lot of repositories so you need a way to manage all the versions....

How to run this thing:
======================
```
GITHUB_USER=<your username> GITHUB_TOKEN=<api token> GITHUB_ORG=<org to pull all the repos> node sparkle.js
```

Make sure the token has org access and repo access and that should just about do it.
