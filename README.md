# nodeVersionRepoSparkleMagic
Lots of nodejs projects? Lots of shared deps? Lots of package.json's?

Want a way to get all of them and get all of the various versions?

Run this tool.

How to run this thing:
======================
```
GITHUB_USER=<your username> GITHUB_TOKEN=<api token> GITHUB_ORG=<org to pull all the repos> node sparkle.js
```

Make sure the token has org access and repo access and that should just about do it.
